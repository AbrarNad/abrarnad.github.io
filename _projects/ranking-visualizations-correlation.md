I co-designed a replication of correlation just-noticeable-difference studies to understand how people read evidence across scatterplots, parallel coordinates, hexbins, and heatmaps. Using reVISit dynamic sequencing and staircase designs, we gathered large-scale crowdsourced data backed by preregistered analyses and provenance-aware logging. I built JND stimuli and adaptive staircases so we could calibrate correlation thresholds per participant while keeping the task replayable.

- **Goal:** Update classic correlation perception results with richer interaction traces and modern encodings.
- **Method:** OSF preregistration; crowdsourced experiment with adaptive sequencing and replayable logs.
- **Status:** Published; contributing to a first-authored short paper.
