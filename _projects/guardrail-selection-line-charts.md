As lead author, I ran a preregistered mixed-design crowd-sourced study of guardrail sampling strategies in persuasive time-series dashboards (COVID-19 cases and stock performance), evaluating trust, performance, and perceived contextual completeness. I built interactive stimuli with reVISit logging and provenance so we could replay behavior from 500+ participants and connect perception with interaction traces.

- **Focus:** Guardrails that temper misleading persuasive line charts without sacrificing comprehension.
- **Method:** Mixed-design online experiment with replayable event traces; preregistered analyses.
- **Tech:** TypeScript, React, Vite, Mantine UI, D3.js, reVISit, Supabase, Firebase.
- **Status:** Under review (EuroVis 2026).
