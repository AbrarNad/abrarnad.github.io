I'm a 2nd Year PhD Student at the University of Utah, Kahlert School of Computing, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am currently co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/team/lex/">Alexander Lex</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.mkoganresearch.com/">Marina Kogan</a> and work with the <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/">Visualization Design Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.mkoganresearch.com/projects/">KORE Lab</a>. I study how people interpret and disseminate charts and data in interactive, online environments. My work sits at the intersection of <b>Information Visualization</b>, <b>Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</b>, and <b>human-centered data science</b>. My goal is to improve comprehension of complex data and decision-making through designing better visualization and storytelling systems.

Please visit my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gTCy_9MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> profile to see my publications.

Formerly, I have worked as a Full Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/"
target="_blank">Optimizely</a> and have three years of experience. I graduated from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/"
target="_blank">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology
(BUET)</a> with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering.

Complementing my scholarly pursuits, I am passionate about films, traveling, competitive FPS gaming, and arts. I embrace diverse cultures and foster a nuanced worldview.
